Graphs and graphs-algorithms explanations:

### Class Edge : This class represents the edges between two nodes , source and destinations in the graph.

#### Class Edge functions:

getSrc – Returning the source.

getDst – Returning the Destination.

gwtWeight – Returning the Weight od the edge.

getTag – Returning the Tag of the edge.

setTag – Setting the tag of the edge.

Copy – coping the object edge.

### Class Node : This class represents a Node in the graph. The node holds an id position weight and the edges from him to another node.

#### Class Edge functions:

getKey – returning the id of the node.

getLocation – Returning the location on the cartesian axis system.

GeEdge – returning the edges.

setEdge – Setting the edges.

getTag – returning the tag.

setTag – setting the tag.

removeEdge – removing an edge from this node.

Copy – coping the object node.

CleanEdges – removing all the edges from the node.

compareTo – compare two nodes by there weight.

### Class Geoloc : This class represents the locations to each node by x axis y axis and z axis.

All the functions there Returning the the locations or setting them ( getters/setters).

### Class DWG: This class represents the Directed graph the graph holds all the nodes and all the edges.

#### Class DWG functions:

getNodes- returning the nodes of the graph.

Getedges – Returning all the edges of the graph.

addNode – Adding a node to the graph.

Connect – connecting two nodes with an edge (that holds weight).

Nodeiter – iterating all the nodes in the graph.

edgeIter – iterating all the edges in the graph.

removeNode – Removing a node from the graph.

removeEdge – Removing an Edge from the graph.

nodeSize – returning number of nodes in the graph.

edgeSize – returning number of edges in the graph.

getMc – returning all the changes in the graph.

setEdges – setting the edges of the DWG.

setNodes – setting the nodes of the DWG.

Copy – coping the DWG.

colorWhite – iterating the nodes and changing the tag to be white(the options for the tag are three colors).

transpose – creating a transpose graph by changing the directions of the edges(that will help us with algorithms in the next class).

### Class DWGAlgorithms: A class that holds a DWG(Directed weighted Graph). This class has the algorithms we can run on the graph.

#### Class DWGAlgorithms functions –

Init – The constructor getting a graph an returning it.

getGraph – returning the graph.

Copy – coping the graph.

BFS – a searching algorithm that is getting the graph and a node and painting every node he get to.

Dijkstra – this is the an algorithm that we are using to get the shortest path, this algorithm is returning the shortest paths from a node to all the other nodes. For more information: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).

Is connected – a function that is checking if the graph is connected by using BFS algorithm we are checking on one node and after that using the transpose dunction and checking on the transpose if there is a rout from this node in the graph and also in the transpose graph so the graph is connected.

Is connected GUI example:

sortestPathDist – calling the Dijkstra algorithm and by that returning the chortest path weight.

shortestPath – calling the dijekstra and returning a list of the shortest path.

getPath – a helper function that is putting the shortest path after using the dijekstra into a list(the dijektra returning a hushMap).

Center – returning the center of the graph , the point where the longest destination of the point is the shortest (using the dijekstra algorithm).

Tsp – this algorithm is finding the shortest path between a list of nodes. We are doing it by rotating the list of cities that we are getting , every rotation we are checking the closest on by using the dijekstra and by using the transpose function we are checking what will be a shorter path to add this city to the end of the rout or to the start(we are looking for the shortest path).

Save – saving the graph into a json file , using the Gson library of google and using a container class.

Load – loading from json file , using the Gson library of google and using a container class.

### Class Container: holds an array of nods and of edges , this class his helping us to save and load to json because any json file holds edges and nodes.

## GUI explanations:

After loading the graph there is a screen that we created by using Jfram.

In this screen we have several options the we created in the bar , by using the Jbar of gui.

File – Where the options are to Save and to load from the file, by using the algorithms of save and load that we explained.

UPDATE – where are the options to edit the nodes and the edges of the graph(removing and addition).

USE ALGORITHMS – where there are all the algorithms we can find in Class DWGAlgorithms.

### We did it by building 5 classes:

GUI\_WINDOW – this is the class which is showing the screen.

GUI\_MANUE – this class is building the menu That we explained at the beginning of this explanation.

GUI\_ADDITIONAL\_WINDOW – that is showing the results of every algorithm on the screen every time.

GUI\_EDGES – drawing the lines between the nodes by normalizing them by the location and the screen size.

GUI\_NODES – drawing the circles(nodes) by normalizing them by the location and the screen size and showing the id.

NOTE : we also added a function that while searching the shortest path between the nodes(while running shortest path algorithm or tsp) we drawing the path and showing the weight of the edge. This is happening also when we are adding an edge. We also showing the node while adding it and the center while searching it.

GUI example (shortest path algoritm):
